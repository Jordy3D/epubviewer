## about

Got bored, made this.  
Works for the novels I bought from J-Novel Club, at least. A few others here and there, I'm sure, as long as they're structured similarly.  

Might get folded into [CBViewer](https://jordy3d.github.io/CBViewer) at some point, but for now it's separate.

## features

- Reads ~~some~~ epub files  
- Renders the book in a web page
- Table of contents
- End-of-chapter/page scrolling to the next chapter/page
